    <span class="arrow"></span>  I was thinking about our conversation the other day and thought I should edit this script a bit.

    <span class="arrow"></span>  Don't worry - it is not a Rick Roll.

    <span class="arrow"></span> Heyyo!
    <br/>
    <span class="arrow"></span> Who do I think I am? That's an interesting question. Alright, let's go a bit old school for this one.  

    Who doth I thinketh I be? Or in the words of the great ol' boy Bill, "What fusilitarian who deserves a tickle on my catastrophe do I think I am?"
    
    Haha. Sounds a bit excessive, but okay. Let's get back to the problem at hand. Who do I think I am to judge?  
    
    Well, I'm the guy
    <br/>
    <span class="arrow"></span> Life's good.
    <br/>
    <span class="arrow"></span> Peace out, G.
